This is my cool new website! {
    color: #FBF5E2;
}

It has some text and some javascript on it {
    color: #FBF5E2;
}

This was made for Mr. Cole's Advanced Cloud Computing class {
    color: #FBF5E2;
}

Additionally, my favorite superhero is Spider-Man {
    color: #E6F8F3.;
}

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    console.log('Website loaded successfully!');
    alert('Welcome to my cloud-deployed website!');
});
